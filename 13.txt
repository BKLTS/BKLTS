I. INTRODUCTION
Today many studies develop at sea; many of these studies
are important to conserve our oceans and coast. These studies
have complexity that can sometimes endanger humans' lives.
An example of this is the Veracruz Reef System in Mexico.
The depth is greater than 30 meters and has a navigation
channel that jeopardizes divers' integrity while conducting
investigations [1]. Other research conducted in Honduras,
found in new coral reef in Tela on 2014, representing the
highest population density after being extinct anywhere in the
Caribbean [2].
The beauty of these sea creatures is admirable. However,
climate change affects these specimens; high temperatures
calcify these reefs by turning them to death. The temperature
trend on the surface continues to rise. This calcification is why
monitoring reefs has become necessary. Survival of corals
reef drop below 50% when maximum temperatures exceed
30.5 ◦C [3]. Figure 1 shows the 30.5 ◦C point and the average
temperature from 2015 to 2020 in Tela, Honduras.
Underwater robots and agricultural robots have a wide
range of applications, including those related to the
monitoring of the environment, and disease detection, among
others [4]. These robots can be divided into remotely operated
vehicles (ROV) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV).
Some ROV uses a cable to establish communication.
Unlike traditional communication, underwater,
radiofrequency, and optical waves. These communications are
not practically underwater. Heat and photons affect optical
transmitters, while radio waves are limited by the dense
marine environment, leaving the option of acoustic modems,
which are excessively expensive [5].
Fig. 1. Tela surface temperature [6]
Radiofrequency technology loses strength while performing
at a greater distance. Optics become more convenient.
However, without becoming efficient, underwater
communication networks are a highly acclaimed research area
today [7]. It shows the difficulties of underwater robot
teleoperators.
AUVs are a challenge because of programming,
mathematical models, and algorithms to control the robot's
trajectories. One option is to generate structured maps in cells
that provide information that spaces are free to move the robot
[8]. This article aims to develop an underwater robot with an
artificial vision system, to monitor coral reefs at different depth
below sea level. This robot uses different modes to accomplish
its tasks, such as teleoperation for surface mobility and video
access in submerging mode.
II. METHOD
The method used in this research is a VDI 2206 model [9].
This method proposed different cycles to develop a functional
prototype. The cycles in this project are the lab design and the
functional prototype. Lab design comprises analyzing the
prototype using simulation software, including hydrodynamic
simulations, electronic design, control design, and vision test.
The functional prototype process includes 3D printing
manufacturing, microprocessors programming, and systems
integrations. Fig. 2 shows the systems and subsystems
developed in this project. The two systems are the mechanical
system and the electronic system. For the lab design, we
validated the mechanical systems using SolidWorks flow
simulation and simulation express. The electronic system using
Matlab and a small aquarium for testing.

III. LAB DESIGN
A. Mechanic System
The first step in the robot's development was to select
components and materials for the structure. The structure
design comprises a 4" diameter waterproof capsule, a PETG
shell. To submerge the robot, you need an airtight design, so
all electronic elements there is a fully sealed acrylic capsule,
placing all electronic elements inside connecting
microcontrollers, turbines and sensors specialized in systems
under the sea. The shell comprises two symmetrical parts used
for mounting the thrust, as shown in figure 3. It has circular
perforations allowing the water flow through the submerging
process.
Fig. 3. Hydrodynamic shell design
The structure volume estimated was 0.0142 m3. We
calculate the buoyancy force using equation 1.
(𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝜌 = 1.024 𝑘𝑔/𝑚3)
𝑓𝑏 = 𝜌𝑔𝑉 = 142.5 𝑁 (1)
The next step is the hydrodynamic evaluation in
SolidWorks. This evaluation comprises two parts: calculating
the force needed to submerging the robot and moving it
underwater.
Fig. 4 is a submerging simulation. The simulation was
performed assuming a fluid velocity of 0.5m/s. It shows the
velocity vectors in different colors depending on their speed,
generating the fluid patterns. The fluid pattern generates some
vortex; however, their velocity is too slow, going from 0 to
0.125m/s. The shell works well for submerging. The bidimensional
flow simulation is shown in Fig. 5. This
simulation shows a flow pattern with no vortex and an
isosurface for velocity representation. The trajectories in the
pattern decrease from 0.517 - 0.258m/s because of the capsule
and shell. The green isosurface represents the fluid velocity
(0.249-0.374m/s) as it advances in the water.
Fig. 4. Submerging flow simulation
Fig. 5. Moving flow simulation
Now we have the force to move the robot into the water.
The robot needs more force for submerging than for moving, as
shown in figure 6. The average force for moving is 13.92 N
and for submerging 15.56 N. The maximum water resistance
force 𝑓𝑤𝑟 is 20.75N. The design of the mechanical system is
completed for the functional prototype manufacturing and
assembling.

B. Electronic System
The robot has an internal and an external communication.
The internal communication is to communicate the three
microcontrollers. This microcontrollers are for the vision
subsystem, one for the storage of sensory data and robot
movement, and a master for executing an internal timer for
missions underwater. The external communication is used to
teleoperate the robot before submerging. This teleoperation

allows the robot to be placed in a favorable position for
submerging.
The robot mobility depends on the thrust force. Fig. 7
shows the robot mobility. There are two thrust to move at sea;
activating both the robot moves forward and reverse. If only
one thrust is turned on, it rotates to one side. It also has two
more thrust for submerging. The robot structure can work
with 4 degrees of freedom (DF), but programming only 3 DF
to achieve bi-dimensional movements and gain stability.
Fig. 7. Robot mobility
The force needed to at sea surface (1 and 2) was calculated
with SolidWorks flow simulation. Now using the thrust
experimental data from the manufacturer. The force should be
greater than 19.4 N between the two thruster. Each thruster
can perform a force between 0-28.4 N at 12 v as show in
figure 8. The R2=99.27% represents a high reliability between
the RPM and the force. Calculating The thruster RPM by
equation 2.
𝑅𝑃𝑀 = −2.315𝑓2 + 149.75𝑓 + 526.15 = 2185 (2)
The force needed for submerging (𝑓𝑑 ) is greater than the
one for moving and can be calculated in equation 3. The
estimated weight (w) of the robot is 120 N. The 43.25 N are
for the two thrust applying equation 2, each thrust RPM is
equal to 2685.
Fig. 8. Force (X axis) and RPM (Y axis) thrust relation [10]
𝑓𝑑 + 𝑤 = 𝑓𝑏 + 𝑓𝑤𝑟 (3)
𝑓𝑑 = 𝑓𝑏 + 𝑓𝑤𝑟 − 𝑤 = 43.25 N
The relation between the PWM signal and the thruster's
RPM was calculated using Matlab system identification tool.
Basing the transfer function in experimental data. Figure 9
shows the output response.

Fig. 9. Thruster step response
The internal sensors are used to the detect potential
problems. It includes two sensors, one for internal temperature
and the leak sensor. The vision subsystem needs a lot of
processing, making the microcontroller to overheat. The
microcontrollers are inside a close capsule, avoiding air flow.
The overheating testing determined a temperature increase
from 29 to 50 C. The vision subsystem turns off with this
increasing temperature. If temperature is higher than 40 C, the
process will interrupt aborting the process. The same happens
with the leaking sensors to prevent incidents inside de capsule.
The external sensors receive information from the sea. The
MS5837-30BA use I2C to send the pressure and temperature
underwater. The sensor operating depth is 300m and 30 bar.
The temperature accuracy is 1 degree Celsius. This sensor
communicates with the Atmega to store the sea temperature.
The depth is used to control the submerging.
Fig. 10. Vision testing
One important test is the artificial vision system. . It started
using a camera with VGA output, which did not give the
expected results proceeded with the acquisition of a 1080
Lifecam webcam. We tested the system for over 12 hours using
a small laboratory aquarium that was implemented for this
project. This aquarium test if the camera could detect, record,
and photograph the goldfish in motion. This testing resulted in
the microcontroller's heating, so a heat sink was added to
improve the operation. The artificial vision system has detected
fish, through a webcam, successfully, for more than an hour
continuously, presenting no inconveniences.
IV. PROTOTYPE INTEGRATION
The shell is 3D printing using PETG, infill is 15%, making
the structure with internal cavities. Metallic cummerbunds

holds the shell with the capsule. Fig. 11 shows the subsystems
integration. The PIC microcontroller is in charge of the
mission time for submerging and data storing. The Atmega is
the main microcontroller. It receives serial communication to
be teleoperated before submerging. Controlling the thrust by
PWM signals moving a RPM calculated in section III. The
electrical consumption of the thrusts is vital to determine the
autonomy of the robot, using two 12V batteries with
7500mA/H. Founding that the thrust that goes up and down
the robot discharges the battery in 120 minutes.
The external sensor use I2C storing information in a SD
card. The Raspberry Pi starts its video process and stores it in
a SD. Motion library to perform two minutes videos when
motion was detected. The sensory system receives
information from the sea, the temperature that is vital in
climate change, and also has a pressure sensor to know the
level of depth at which it is located.
Fig. 11. Schematic diagram
We show the functional algorithm that describes the robot
process in Fig. 11. The teleoperation mode activates once
serial communication is stable. This mode allows the user to
move the robot to the sea surface by using a control. The
control has submerging button in which it activate a timer and
monitoring the internal sensors. The set_t is the time set by
the user the data acquisition record videos, photos and the sea
temperature.
The submerging mode turns on the thrust to introduce the
robot inside the sea until a define max depth (max_d). When
the depth is greater than the max_d thrusts turn off. The
floating mode moves the robot by the floating force until it
gets the define minimum depth (min_d). This process has the
advantage of using less energy to maintain the robot
underwater. The process continues until it is greater than set_t.
Then the robot gets to the surface because of the floating force.
Serial communication can connect it to teleoperation mode to
start the process again. The submerging mode also has a close
loop. First, it uses an acceleration ramp to star thrust, reducing
strong movements. This acceleration ramp increase from 0 to
2685 RPM in 1.5s, saving the actual depth. The controller
compares the actual depth with the real depth, increasing
PWM signals if it's necessary.

V. EXPERIMENT
We selected Tela, Honduras for testing the robot in the sea.
This place contains two small coral reef barriers. Robot
parameters where set_t = 10min, max_d = 5m, and min_d =
3m. The waves' tallness were less than 0.5m permitting a stable
sea movement. The teleoperation mode has no inconvenient for
displacement of the robot in the sea surface. Submerging the
robot has greater challenge. The robot's movement on some
occasions was too fast, so the camera can't properly focus the
images. Fig. 14 shows a coral reefs section captured from the
video. After two hours of measurements, temperature varies
from 26.59 to 29.74 C.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In lab design section, implementing a software simulation
technique was important to develop the robot. Another
example of this technique is the projections of motion velocity
[12]. The flow simulation method used to calculate a balloon
prototype force is a similar method used in this project [11].
Drag force and coefficient of drag are among other factors
that determine the profile for the blimp design.
The robot uses a teleoperation mode to move on the sea
surface. Other systems take advantage of minicomputer with
access point and Wi-Fi connection. In addition, robots can
work together, with the control center and with an external
device [14]. The UART communication is a simple way to
teleoperate the robot in short distance improvements could
increase the communication distance.
The robot mechanical design has accomplished its task.
The control should be improve adding a mathematical model
for the robot displacement under water. This improvement
should be like the thrust dispatching module that calculates
control signals [12]. A sonar sensor could help to map its
environment.
