Abstract—In order to meet the needs of fast detection and classification
of different marine targets during intelligent unmanned
surface vehicle (USV) operations, In this paper, I introduce a
convolutional neural network based on one of the most effective
object detection algorithms, named YOLOv3, to classify and
detect images of different marine targets. Firstly, I showed
the network structure of the algorithm in this paper. Then, I
explained how I got the optimal anchor box parameter of the
algorithm. Finally, I improved the activation function to make
the algorithm more robust to noise. The final results show that
the MAP of the detector in this paper is 91:83%,and we reach a
detection rate of 58.3 fps by improving the YOLOV3 algorithm.

I. INTRODUCTION
Nearly 70% of the Earth’s surface area is covered by the
ocean, and 90% of the world economy is done by ocean
transportation. Today, with the deepening of globalization, the
ocean is an important link for economic and cultural exchanges
among countries all over the world. Marine target identification
is playing an important part of modern maritime intelligent
monitoring system.It is of great significance to identify all
kinds of ship targets in monitoring maritime traffic, safeguarding
maritime rights and interests, and improving early warning
capability of coastal defense quickly and accurately.
In recent years, the target detection method based on deep
learning has made great breakthroughs, and the main methods
can be divided into two categories. One is based on the
regional recommendation target detection algorithm. Firstly,
the regional target is used to generate the candidate target, and
then the convolutional neural network is used for processing.
The accuracy is high but it cannot meet the requirements
of real-time application. The representative algorithms are
RCNN[1], Fast RCNN[2] , Faster RCNN[3], Mask RCNN[4],
etc. The other type is the target detection algorithm based
on the regression method. The detection problem is treated
as a regression problem, and the target position and category
are directly predicted. This type of method is fast, but relatively
low precision. Representative algorithms are YOLO[5],
YOLOv2[6], YOLOv3[7], etc. Xiu Li, et al. classified and
detected twelve species of fish using Faster R-CNN[8]. Zuoying
Cui,et al. proposed a method on account of the 32-layer
residual networks to classify different categories of plankton
images[9]. Minsung Sung, et al. applied the YOLO neural
network to detect and classify fish[10].Medhdi et al. proposed
an underwater cable recognition method based on texture
features[11].
However, there are many difficulties in image classification
and object detection due to the complex and harsh sea conditions.
In this paper, we use a convolutional neural network
based YOLOv3 algorithm to classify and detect images of
different marine targets.
II. MODEL DETECTION PROCESS
YOLOv3 is a regression-based target detection algorithm.
Firstly, the input images are divided into S*S grids. Each
grid cell predicts N bounding boxes while training.The information
contained in each bounding box can be represented as
tx; ty; tw; th C , where tx; ty; tw; th represent predicted coordinate
information and C represent predicted confidence information.
